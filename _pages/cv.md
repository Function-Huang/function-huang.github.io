## Research Experience

### Research Intern
*Shanghai AI Laboratory* | *May 2025 – Present*
- Conducted research on large language models for formal language reasoning.
- In the paper *Re:Form [<sup>4</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16331)*, I implemented reinforcement learning algorithms to post-train models on the Dafny formal language, surpassing all strong baselines on a key software engineering benchmark.

### Research Assistant
*The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen* | *June 2024 – Present*
- Focused on bandit algorithms, particularly dueling bandits.
- For the work on *Federated Linear Dueling Bandits [<sup>5</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01085)*, I independently provided theoretical proofs for the `FLDB-OGD` algorithm and conducted all experiments.

### Research Assistant
*Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data* | *Jan 2024 – May 2024*
- Developed a benchmark for mathematical modeling, detailed in our NAACL paper and the open-source Mamo project [<sup>6</sup>](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/Mamo).
- I independently designed the benchmark, processed data, implemented all code, and ran experiments.
- Our work was featured in *MIT Technology Review China [<sup>7</sup>](https://www.mittrchina.com/news/detail/13738)*.
